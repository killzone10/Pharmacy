# Pharmacy

## This project is pharmacy simulation written in c ++ for  project in the beggining of studies. Used c ++ 11 standard. 
# How to run:
## Use visual studio code --> run task json every compilation method is specified in the file

## How does program work:
The pharmacy is main class customers can come and buy things that are located in storage class. Some things can be bought anytime , and some don't (prescription is needed).
Pharmacy can also run out of items, so the storage has to be filled up. To do that items have to be bought from provider.
Things sold by pharmacy are:
  - sirups,
  - herbs,
  - suplements,
  - pills.
 
 People that are in pharmacy:
  - provider (selling items),
  - customer (buying medicaments),
  - pharmacist (seller) (can also create/produce specific drugs).
  

## Frankly speaking its one of my first projects so it has a lot of downsides for example atomics and mutexes should be added there.
